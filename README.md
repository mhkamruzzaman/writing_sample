Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) has become a central planning strategy in U.S.A.
metropolitan regions. Yet its implementation is slow and piecemeal despite widespread policy
support. This paper argues that TOD fails not because of technical or regulatory deficiencies but
because it confronts deeply entrenched institutional and cultural structures that privileges
automobility. Drawing on institutional, organizational, political-economic, and communicative
planning theories, the paper shows how auto-oriented norms are embedded in cultural–cognitive
meanings, professional routines, zoning systems, governance fragmentation, and regime
coalitions. These structures shape development behavior even when TOD-supportive policies are
adopted. The analysis reframes TOD as an institutional transformation project requiring changes
to cultural meanings, legitimacy structures, and collective narratives—not merely zoning or
transit investments. The paper concludes by outlining implications for planning theory and
practice, arguing that meaningful TOD implementation requires cultural alignment, collaborative
governance, and long-term institutional learning.
